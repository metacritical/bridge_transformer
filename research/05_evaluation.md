## 5. Evaluation Framework

### 5.1 Knowledge Boundary Detection

To evaluate the model's ability to recognize when it needs external knowledge, we propose:

1. **Knowledge Boundary Precision**: Percentage of bridge activations that occur at genuine knowledge boundaries.
2. **Knowledge Boundary Recall**: Percentage of genuine knowledge boundaries that trigger bridge activation.
3. **Activation Timing**: Measurement of how early in the generation process the model detects knowledge boundaries.

### 5.2 Query Generation Quality

To evaluate the quality of neural query representations:

1. **Retrieval Precision@k**: Precision of retrieved documents using the generated query.
2. **Query-Document Alignment**: Semantic similarity between the query and the most relevant documents.
3. **Query Diversity**: Measurement of how the query representations vary across different knowledge domains.

### 5.3 Factuality Improvement

To measure improvements in factual accuracy:

1. **Fact Verification**: Percentage of generated statements that align with verified facts.
2. **Hallucination Reduction**: Comparison of hallucination rates between base model and bridge model.
3. **Knowledge Integration Accuracy**: How accurately retrieved information is incorporated into generation.

### 5.4 Reasoning Preservation

To verify that the bridge mechanism preserves reasoning capabilities:

1. **Reasoning Benchmark Performance**: Comparison of performance on reasoning tasks with and without bridge activation.
2. **Cognitive Disruption Measurement**: Assessment of whether bridge activation disrupts ongoing reasoning chains.
3. **Long-Form Quality**: Evaluation of coherence and consistency in long-form generation.

### 5.5 Efficiency Metrics

To measure computational and architectural efficiency:

1. **Activation Rate**: How often the bridge mechanism is triggered during generation.
2. **Latency Impact**: Additional time required for bridge activation and retrieval.
3. **Parameter Efficiency**: Number of additional parameters relative to the base model.
