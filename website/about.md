# About the Project

The Bridge Neural Networks project introduces a novel architecture ("Abhay Architecture") for integrating external knowledge into language models without context window pollution.

## Research Focus

This research focuses on creating direct neural pathways for external knowledge access in language models. The Abhay Architecture allows models to:

1. Detect knowledge boundaries through trained neuron activations
2. Generate neural query representations
3. Integrate external information directly at the hidden state level

This approach preserves the model's reasoning capacity while enabling selective access to vast external knowledge sources.
