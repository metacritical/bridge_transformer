## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Model Architecture Specifications

For our reference implementation, we propose the following specifications:

- **Base Model**: A transformer-based language model with 12-24 layers
- **Bridge Neurons**: 3% of neurons in layers 4, 8, and 12
- **Query Encoder**: 2-layer MLP with hidden dimension 256
- **Response Integrator**: 2-layer MLP with hidden dimension 256
- **Bridge Activation Threshold**: 0.8

### 6.2 Knowledge Service Implementation

The external knowledge service can be implemented using:

1. **Vector Database**: For dense retrieval from document collections
2. **Structured Knowledge Base**: For entity-relation queries
3. **Web Search API**: For up-to-date information
4. **Tool API**: For specialized functions like calculation or data analysis

The modular design allows for flexibility in knowledge source selection based on the application domain.

### 6.3 Inference Optimization

During inference, several optimizations can be applied:

1. **Caching**: Frequent queries and responses can be cached to reduce latency.
2. **Batch Processing**: Multiple potential bridge activations can be batched for efficient retrieval.
3. **Adaptive Thresholding**: The bridge activation threshold can be dynamically adjusted based on confidence scores.
4. **Early Termination**: Bridge activation can be skipped for high-confidence generations.
