## Implementation Code

We also discussed code implementations for:

1. Core Bridge model architecture
2. Data preparation and generation using LLM-powered approaches
3. Training methodology with multi-phase curriculum
4. Vector database for knowledge storage and retrieval

## Publishing Considerations

We discussed publishing considerations including:
1. Feasibility of publishing as a solo researcher without traditional academic credentials
2. Potential venues for publication, including conferences and preprint servers
3. Strategies for making the paper compelling despite not having experimental results

## Next Steps

Suggested next steps for your research:

1. Finalize the paper by combining the markdown files and referencing the figures
2. Consider implementing a minimal proof-of-concept of the bridge mechanism
3. Create a project website/repository to share the concept
4. Submit the paper to arXiv to establish precedence while preparing for peer review
5. Consider submitting to a workshop for initial feedback before targeting larger conferences
