## Direct Neural Pathways for External Knowledge Integration

### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) face inherent limitations in knowledge access and factuality, constrained by their parametric knowledge representations. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, it suffers from context window pollution, reduced reasoning capacity, and unnatural integration of external information. 

We propose Bridge Neural Networks (BNNs), a novel architecture that repurposes a subset of neurons to create dedicated neural pathways for external knowledge access. Unlike RAG, BNNs detect knowledge boundaries through trained neuron activations, generate neural query representations, and integrate external information directly at the hidden state level without consuming context tokens. 

We present a theoretical foundation for BNNs, detail their architecture (which we refer to as the "Abhay Architecture"), outline training methodology, and propose evaluation frameworks that measure factuality, reasoning preservation, and integration quality. Our analysis suggests BNNs offer a more elegant and efficient approach to knowledge integration that preserves model reasoning capacity while enabling selective external information access.

## Research Focus

This research focuses on creating direct neural pathways for external knowledge access in language models. The Abhay Architecture allows models to:

1. Detect knowledge boundaries through trained neuron activations
2. Generate neural query representations
3. Integrate external information directly at the hidden state level

This approach preserves the model's reasoning capacity while enabling selective access to vast external knowledge sources.
