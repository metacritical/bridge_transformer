# Bridge Neural Networks Research Project

This repository contains the research paper "Bridge Neural Networks: Direct Neural Pathways for External Knowledge Integration" which introduces the "Abhay Architecture" for external knowledge integration in language models.

## Project Structure

- `figures/`: SVG diagrams for the paper
- `latex/`: LaTeX implementation of the paper using the Tau template
- `markdown/`: Markdown version of the paper
- `website/`: Academic website using Jekyll
- `output/`: Generated PDFs and other outputs

## Build System

This project includes a build system that can generate the paper in different formats:

### Prerequisites

- **For Markdown PDF**: Pandoc and XeLaTeX
- **For LaTeX PDF**: A complete LaTeX distribution (TeXLive, MikTeX, etc.)
- **For Website**: Jekyll and Ruby
- **For SVG Conversion**: Inkscape or rsvg-convert

### Usage

```bash
# Generate PDF from Markdown
./build.sh markdown

# Set up academic website
./build.sh website

# Generate academic PDF using LaTeX
./build.sh latex

# Generate all formats
./build.sh all

# Show help
./build.sh help
```

## Figures

The paper includes the following figures:

1. `figure1_bridge_architecture.svg`: Bridge Neural Network Architecture
2. `figure2_information_flow_comparison.svg`: Comparison between RAG and Bridge Neural Networks
3. `figure3_pruning_bridge_allocation.svg`: Pruning-Guided Bridge Allocation
4. `figure4_mathematical_framework.svg`: Mathematical Framework
5. `figure5_training_curriculum.svg`: Training Curriculum

## The "Abhay Architecture"

The "Abhay Architecture" refers to the proposed bridge neural network design that creates direct neural pathways for external knowledge access. Key components include:

1. Bridge detector neurons
2. Neural query encoder
3. External knowledge service
4. Response integrator

This architecture allows language models to access external knowledge without consuming context window tokens, maintaining full reasoning capacity while adding factual accuracy.

## Paper Formats

### Markdown PDF

The Markdown PDF version is a simpler format with a clean design, suitable for initial reviews and sharing.

### LaTeX PDF

The LaTeX PDF uses the Tau template which provides a professional academic layout with proper formatting for equations, figures, and references.

### Academic Website

The website version is built using Jekyll and provides an online accessible version of the research with interactive elements.
