## 3. Bridge Neural Network Architecture

### 3.1 Conceptual Framework

The Bridge Neural Network architecture consists of four key components:
1. A base transformer language model
2. Bridge detector neurons
3. Neural query encoder
4. Response integrator

These components work together to create a seamless flow from language generation to knowledge retrieval and back to generation, without disrupting the context window. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture.

### 3.2 Bridge Detector Neurons

The bridge detector mechanism is the core innovation of our approach. We repurpose a small subset (typically 3-5%) of neurons in specific transformer layers to serve as bridge detectors. This builds on insights that transformer feed-forward layers naturally function as key-value memories [24], suggesting that neurons already encode knowledge boundaries.

Formally, given a transformer with hidden dimension $h$ and layer $l$, we select a subset of neurons $B_l \subset \{1, 2, ..., h\}$ to serve as bridge neurons. The activations of these neurons, denoted $a_{B_l}$, are monitored during the forward pass.

The bridge detection function $D$ is defined as:

$$D(a_{B_l}) = \sigma(W_d \cdot a_{B_l} + b_d)$$

where $W_d$ and $b_d$ are learned parameters, and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function. The bridge is activated when $D(a_{B_l}) > \tau$, where $\tau$ is a threshold hyperparameter (typically set to 0.8).

This approach has several advantages:
- It maintains the original network architecture
- It leverages existing neurons that have learned to represent knowledge boundaries
- It adds minimal additional parameters

Bridge detection occurs at multiple layers (typically 2-3 layers) in the transformer stack, allowing the model to detect knowledge boundaries at different levels of abstraction.

### 3.3 Neural Query Encoder

When the bridge detector neurons indicate a knowledge boundary, the neural query encoder translates the bridge neuron activations into a query representation for the external knowledge system.

The query encoder function $Q$ is defined as:

$$Q(a_{B_l}) = \tanh(W_q2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_q1 \cdot a_{B_l} + b_q1) + b_q2)$$

where $W_q1$, $W_q2$, $b_q1$, and $b_q2$ are learned parameters. This produces a query embedding $q$ that captures the semantic content of the knowledge request.

Unlike traditional RAG approaches that extract lexical queries, our neural query representation is derived directly from the model's internal state, allowing for more nuanced and precise retrieval requests.

### 3.4 External Knowledge Service

The external knowledge service receives the neural query representation and returns relevant information. While this component is not the focus of our architectural innovation, it is a necessary part of the system.

The knowledge service $K$ maps a query embedding $q$ to a response embedding $r$:

$$r = K(q)$$

This can be implemented using various retrieval methods, including vector similarity search, structured knowledge bases, or API calls to external services.

### 3.5 Response Integrator

The response integrator incorporates the retrieved information back into the model's hidden states without modifying the context window. This is achieved through a neural mapping function $I$ that transforms the response embedding $r$ into a format compatible with the model's hidden states:

$$I(r) = W_i2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_i1 \cdot r + b_i1) + b_i2$$

The resulting integration vector is added to the hidden states at strategic positions in the transformer stack, typically at layers following the bridge activation.

This direct neural integration differs fundamentally from RAG approaches that inject retrieved text into the context window. It preserves the model's reasoning capacity while enriching it with external knowledge exactly where needed.
