## 9. Conclusion

Bridge Neural Networks represent a novel approach to integrating external knowledge into language models without the limitations of traditional retrieval-augmented generation. By repurposing a small subset of neurons to create dedicated neural pathways for knowledge access, BNNs maintain the model's reasoning capabilities while enabling selective and efficient access to vast external knowledge sources.

Our theoretical analysis suggests that BNNs offer significant advantages in terms of context efficiency, integration quality, and computational performance. The proposed architecture and training methodology provide a foundation for empirical validation in future work.

BNNs point towards a future where language models can seamlessly leverage both parametric and non-parametric knowledge, combining the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the accuracy and timeliness of external information sources.
